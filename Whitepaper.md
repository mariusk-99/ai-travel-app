### Purpose of project:

The aim of this system is to simplify the life of people who want to travel but hate planning. This tool has to purpose to create custom itineraries based on the customer’s preferences. 

For example: Alex likes travelling but doesn’t like planning or searching for things to do, places to visit, and looking for restaurants. He doesn’t know how to go about finding the best deals and the best rated attractions. 


Lets say that Alex wants to travel for a week in europe but doesn’t know how to find the optimal location that matches his budget and travel preferences. Our tool will develop an itinerary with recommendations such as:

- Recommended destinations
- Optimal Flights
- Stays dependending on the budget
- Places to visit - based on online guides, google maps reviews
- Restaurants
- Much more..
